# Random Small Projects

Several beginner projects.

- `selector.py`: simply a random selector to tell who to facetime.
- `login.py`: a fake login that lets you look like you're hacking into some super secret mainframe.
- `rock_paper_scissors.py`: rock paper scissors.
- `web_app`: build your own web app using flask.
